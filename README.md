**Valentine project**
My first little project using JS,HTML and CSS

About me
I am a UNI student in my 4th semester of CS study. Currently learning C,Java as part of my study and JS,HTML and CSS through various courses mainly on UDEMY in my spare time.

Project overview
Simple, UI and UX focused design. Rotate function. Sounds and music. Quiz, Gifs and animations.

Inspiration and roadmap
I came across this 'concept' for valentine page on instagram and decided to use it as my first project in this area. I created the whole design, functions, logic and features with help of ChatGPT for faster progress. GPT wrote most of the CSS since I am still improving in that area.

Other

I am actively working on improving my skills, mainly on design. I planned to add 'date configurator' but didnt have enough time. My girlfrined was super happy.
